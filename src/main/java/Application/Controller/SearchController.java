     * of the URL following the ? symbol, such as cats.site/cats?term=photos&format=png&orderby=popularity. For instance,
     * if you are writing an endpoint intended to return some search results, it would be conventional to include not
     * just the search term (eg 'cat photos') as a query parameter, but other site metrics such as filters
     * ('format=png'), ordering ('orderby=popularity'), or pagination ('page=2'). In a RESTful API, it is generally
     * recommended that a path param only identifies the entity or resource that you are working with, and variables
     * that refine how the backend should interact with the data should be included as a path parameter.
     *
     * Below is an example of how to extract a path parameter from an HTTP request.
     * This will extract the query parameter "term" from an HTTP request to localhost:9000/cats?term=searchterm,
     * responding with "searchterm".
